    heading: About me
    text: |
      I design user-centred digital products and experiences. My skills span user experience design, user interface and interaction design, design systems, production and front-end development.

      I'm involved in every step and iteration of the human-centred design process, through discovery, exploration, production and validation.

      Let's build something together. Get in touch.
