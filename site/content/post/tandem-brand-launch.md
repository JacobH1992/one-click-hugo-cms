### Starting out

As one of the first employees of Tandem I was involved in helping create and iterate a new brand. We started with a single question, "What is a good bank?" and a desire to reinvent banking to improve people's lives.

For the first few months we operated under the guise of '#agoodbank', a non-brand that would be used to gain a greater understanding of what people really needed from a bank. We ran discovery workshops, interviews and created a community of people we called 'Co-Founders' â€” a group of ordinary, un-banky people who would help shape and build the kind of bank they wanted.

Anyone could become a Co-Founder and each one got a share in the bank and their own membership card. We even created an app to allow Co-Founders to see what we were working on and for us to test ideas and gather feedback.

### A new brand

For the next six months, we set about defining the brand for the new bank. I was involved in and helped facilitate numerous workshops, Co-Founder events and testing sessions with [Wolff Olins](http://www.wolffolins.com/){:target="_blank"} and other Tandem employees. We explored multiple names and directions before finding 'Tandem'.
