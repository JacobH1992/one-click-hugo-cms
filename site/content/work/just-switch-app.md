### App design

{{< figure src="/img/just-switch-app/jw-screens-1.jpg" alt="First screens" >}}

We made use of a simple colour palette to design many illustrative icons to help guide users through the app in a more engaging way. We also used colour to help indicate the path we wanted people to take most often in the journey.

### Landing page and marketing

A simple landing page was built to help market the app.
