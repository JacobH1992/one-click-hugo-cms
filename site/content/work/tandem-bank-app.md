### Background

Tandem is on a mission to build a new kind of bank; one that always puts the customer first. Generally, Tandem is aimed at a millennial audience, but in-depth research and consumer segmentation carried out by Tandem’s insights team lead to the target customer for Tandem’s initial launch being the ‘Live for the moment’ segment.

They are characterised by some common traits:

* __Slightly younger__, perhaps with a wealthier background, living for today
* __Borrowing unwisely__ to fund lifestyle, often hit with ‘unfair’ charges, could use help planning
* __Looking for something simpler__, more engaging, more fun

### User journeys

Hundreds of user journeys had to be created in order to build the app. From originations to Registration and Log In.

### Prototyping & Testing

### Concept design

Countless app concepts were designed to try and push and evolve the app's visual style. Here are some example of concepts I worked on that didn't make it:

### Atomic design

We wanted to design a beautiful interface that could be quickly iterated whilst at the same time being at least be AA accessible. Our answer was to build a design system and make use of Atomic design principles.

Components were designed to be shared and re-used across multiple journeys and product areas.
Each component is made up of smaller parts (atoms) and styles - all of which adhere the design system’s guidelines (grid, spacing, typography, colour etc.)

I was part of the team that created the design system from scratch. I was responsible for establishing the process with product and engineering and defining the overarching guidelines that effect the design system holistically, as well as contributing to many of the 300+ individual components.
