### About

Tandem is a 'challenger' bank that combines traditional banking products such as credit cards and savings accounts with a modern banking app experience that helps customers save money and manage their spending. As a brand-new bank, everything part of the customer experience had to be designed from scratch.

The app for launch gave users the opportunity to connect their existing bank accounts to the app (aggregation) as well as use their new Tandem banking products - this gives users a more holistic view of their finances and Tandem a way to offer new ways for them to save money.

### Target users

Tandem was initially aimed at a millennial audience. In-depth research and consumer segmentation narrowed this down to a ‘Live for the moment’ segment becoming Tandem's intital target customer. As such, the app and product experiences were designed for this segment.

The 'live for the moment' segment are characterised by some common traits:

* Slightly younger, perhaps with a wealthier background, __**living for today**__
* __**Borrowing unwisely**__ to fund lifestyle, often hit with ‘unfair’ charges, could use help planning
* __**Looking for something simpler**__, more engaging, more fun

The app and products for launch were co-designed with members of this segment, sourced from Tandem's 20,000+ strong community of 'Co-Founders'. They became the banks early adopters and are still involved in helping shape propositions, products and features.

### Journeys & Interaction

Hundreds of user journeys and interaction patterns had to be designed and tested in order to piece the app together. Some of the most complex areas of the app to design were the application forms for savings accounts and credit cards. The forms were designed to be cross-platform for iOS, Android and responsive web.

{{< figure src="/img/tdm-app/tdm-journey-process.jpg" alt="Originations process flow and wireframes" >}} 

I was one of three designers that tackled these journeys for both Tandem’s savings products and credit card products. We started with the operational process flows that had already been put together and ran workshops with subject matter experts to map out 'dream' scenarios for each journey. Once we had our 'dream' journeys we overlayed any technical and regulatory constraints and started to put together wireframes.

Lots of personal information needed to be collected from the user during the application and the order that we collected this information was important. I worked closely with engineers to understand back-end processes and shape how this information should be collected from users in both the UI and the client.

Every part of the form design from structure to copywriting was considered, prototyped and iterated on heavily. Form features such as setting expectations up-front, progress indication, autofilling information, clarity of copy and validation were all added to give the user the best experience.

To further stand out from traditional banks we added 'moments of delight' throughout the applications - these were moments that brought to life Tandem's personality and delivered a more uniquely Tandem experience. One feature of the Tandem credit card was that you could choose from 4 colours so this was one such moment we invested in making particularly 'delightful' for the user when applying.

Other journeys I worked on included aggregation (connecting other bank accounts), login & registration, core banking and payments. Much of the fundamentals of Tandem's design language and principles were born out of the early work of designing these forms and they were continually iterated as the design language matured.

### Onboarding

One of the key challenges we had with the app was to ensure users understood how it worked and what the benefits of using it would be.

### Design System

We wanted to design beautiful interfaces that could be quickly iterated whilst at the same time being at least be AA accessible. Our answer was to make use of Atomic Design principles.

{{< figure src="/img/tdm-app/tdm-components2.jpg" alt="A text input component" >}}

Components were designed to be shared and re-used across multiple journeys and product areas.
Each component is made up of smaller parts (atoms) and styles - all of which adhere the design system’s guidelines (grid, spacing, typography, colour etc.)

{{< figure src="/img/tdm-app/tdm-components5.jpg" alt="A family of components" >}}

I was part of the team that created the design system from scratch. I was responsible for establishing the process with product and engineering and defining the overarching guidelines that effect the design system holistically, as well as contributing to many of the 300+ individual components.
