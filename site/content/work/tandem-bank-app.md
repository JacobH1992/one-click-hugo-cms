### About

Tandem is a 'challenger' bank that combines traditional banking products such as credit cards and savings accounts with a modern banking app experience to help their customers save money and manage their spending.

As a brand-new bank, everything from the marketing website and applying for a banking product to managing your money in-app had to be designed from scratch. The Tandem app was built for iOS and Android and parts of it were also built as a responsive web app.

### Target users

Tandem was initially aimed at a millennial audience. In-depth research and consumer segmentation narrowed this down to a ‘Live for the moment’ segment becoming Tandem's intital target customer. As such, the app and product experiences were designed for this segment.

The 'live for the moment' segment are characterised by some common traits:

* Slightly younger, perhaps with a wealthier background, __**living for today**__
* __**Borrowing unwisely**__ to fund lifestyle, often hit with ‘unfair’ charges, could use help planning
* __**Looking for something simpler**__, more engaging, more fun

The app and products for launch were co-designed with members of this segment, sourced from Tandem's 20,000+ strong community of 'Co-Founders'. They became the banks early adopters and are still involved in helping shape propositions, products and features.

### User Journeys

Hundreds of user journeys had to be created in order to build the app. From product originations to registration and log in.

Countless app concepts were designed to try and push and evolve the app's visual style. Here are some example of concepts I worked on that didn't make it:

### Design System

We wanted to design beautiful interfaces that could be quickly iterated whilst at the same time being at least be AA accessible. Our answer was to make use of Atomic Design principles.

Components were designed to be shared and re-used across multiple journeys and product areas.
Each component is made up of smaller parts (atoms) and styles - all of which adhere the design system’s guidelines (grid, spacing, typography, colour etc.)

I was part of the team that created the design system from scratch. I was responsible for establishing the process with product and engineering and defining the overarching guidelines that effect the design system holistically, as well as contributing to many of the 300+ individual components.
