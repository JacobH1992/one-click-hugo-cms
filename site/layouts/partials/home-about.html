          <p>Jacob is, without doubt, one of the most talented people I have worked with. He has a rare ability to take a complex problem and turn it into a (seemingly) simple solution. From UX and creative design to commercial plans and agile delivery, he has an exceptional understanding of how to make innovations work. A great product designer.</p>

          <p>Working with Jacob has been gratifying and a pleasure. He has been highly dependable, eager to progress fast and proactive to join the dots across design, product and tech. He was instrumental in building design systems and integration processes, as well as for a series of UI technology reviews and decisions. Great to have Jacob on the team!</p>

          <p>Whist his portfolio will vouch for his design skills, I want to call out Jacobâ€™s knowledge and appreciation for all the other specialisms involved in creating software. During my time at Just, Jacob was someone who I could rely on to Champion Agility and was instrumental in the set-up of new Scrum teams. If I had to set-up a dream team, Jacob would be on it!</p>
